# fluttermint

A Fedimint wallet in Flutter + Rust. DO NOT USE WITH REAL MONEY! This is for tinkering, only.

## Paul's Notes

`just gen` generates the language bindings

If you're following the flutter_rust_bridge guide, you'll want ["Alternative NDK setup"](http://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/template/setup_android.html?highlight=ndk#alternative-ndk-setup) and compile with rust nightly for now.

## Justin's Notes

- In order to run this on a hardware device and connect to federation running on desktop, you need to turn on "System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing". Turn on all USB-related options.

# Android

When making a release, increment version number and build number in pubspec.yaml: 0.5.1+12 -> 0.5.2+13. Suffix is android build number.

````
$ cat ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
ANDROID_NDK=/Users/justin/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle

Tail logs from terminal:

```
adb logcat | grep -F "`adb shell ps | grep com.justinmoon.fluttermint  | tr -s [:space:] ' ' | cut -d' ' -f2`"
```

# Testflight

Build the IPA:

```
flutter build ipa
```

Uploaded it using transport app.

# Play Store

## App Bundle (recommended, but it seems more complex)

```
flutter build appbundle
```

Upload that to google play. [Here](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#offline-using-the-bundle-tool) are some docs about testing it locally.
